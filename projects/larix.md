Larix is the ultimate lending gateway on Solana, adopted a dynamic interest rate model and created more capital-efficient risk management pools, as such a broad selection of collateral types can be fully utilized in a safe way. Furthermore, the rewarding system based on a delicately designed token economy enables continuous incentive allocation to boost demands.
All valuable assets, including crypto tokens, stablecoins, synthetic assets, NFTs, and asset-backed securities (account receivables, invoices, mortgages, etc.) are soon accepted as collaterals to borrow crypto assets, generate yield, and power the real economy.
